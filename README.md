# My own configuration of **Neovim**, **Tmux** and **Alacritty** (***dotfiles***)

This is my personal configuration of **Neovim**, **Tmux** and **Alacrity**. I already had a repository of my Neovim configuration but I don't included the other config files and
It was so frustrating for me copy and paste in a USB the files; so I decided to make an a new repository with all my stuff and here we are! Organized and in their own section 

## You want it? You got it!
If you wanna use this config you can. You need to use `stow` in your distro, e.g.:

For Debian distros
```
$ sudo apt install stow
```
For Fedora.
```
$ sudo dnf install stow
```
Just install it with the package manager of your distro.

***WARNING***

Before you use this config files, It is a good practice to do a backup for your own config in case you wanna go back to them. Once you did a backup file now you can use this dotfiles.
